# Algo Trading Test Strategy

This repository contains a simple algorithmic trading strategy that plots the Simple Moving Average (SMA) for 50 and 200 days. The strategy is implemented in two files:

- `SMApython.ipynb`: Contains the class code for calculating the SMA.
- `TestOne.ipynb`: Implements the `SMApython` class and plots the SMA graph.

## Usage

To use this strategy, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Clone this repository to your local machine.
3. Open `TestOne` in your preferred Python editor or IDE.
4. Run `TestOne` to execute the strategy.
5. View the plotted graph showing the SMA for 50 and 200 days.

Feel free to modify the code according to your requirements or integrate it into your own projects. If you encounter any issues or have suggestions for improvements, please don't hesitate to open an issue or submit a pull request. Your feedback is valuable and helps improve the quality of this project for everyone.
